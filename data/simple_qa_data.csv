What is dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the more common type of AMD. It develops very slowly and causes a gradual change in your central vision. 
What is age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition that affects the middle part of your vision. It usually first affects people in their 50s and 60s. It does not cause total blindness. But it can make everyday activities like reading and recognising faces difficult.
Does AMD cause blindness?,AMD does not cause total blindness. But it can make everyday activities like reading and recognising faces difficult.

How long does it take for dry AMD to develop?,"Dry AMD usually takes a long time – sometimes years, to get to its final stage. At its worst, dry AMD causes a blank patch in the centre of your vision in both of your eyes."
What is wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?,"About 10 to 15 per cent of people who develop AMD have wet AMD, often having had dry AMD to begin with. Wet AMD can develop very quickly, causing serious changes to your central vision in a short period of time, over days or weeks. You develop wet AMD when the cells of the macula stop working correctly and your body starts growing new blood vessels to fix the problem. As these blood vessels grow in the wrong place, they cause swelling and bleeding underneath the macula – this is why it’s called “wet” AMD. This new blood vessel growth is medically known as neovascularisation. It causes more damage to your macula and eventually leads to scarring. "

Is there treatment for wet AMD?,"Treatment is available for wet AMD, which stops the new blood vessels from growing and damaging your macula. This treatment usually needs to be given quickly before the new blood vessels do too much damage to your macula. If the blood vessels are left to grow, the scarring and the sight loss they cause is usually permanent."
What is the treatment for dry AMD?,"Unfortunately, at the moment there is no way to treat dry AMD. Although research is going on to try and find out why the cells of the macula stop working, this has yet to lead to a proven treatment."
What is the treatment for wet AMD?,"The treatment available on the NHS for wet AMD is a group of medications called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs. As new blood vessels form in your eye, your body produces a chemical which encourages further new blood vessel growth. Anti-VEGF drugs interfere with this chemical and stop the vessels from growing, minimising further damage to your sight."
What are the symptoms of AMD and when should I seek help?,"Everyone can have slightly different symptoms for AMD, but usually the first thing you’ll notice is that it’s harder to see detail, such as small print. You may find that your vision has a small blurred area in the centre. Straight lines may look distorted or wavy, or like there’s a little bump in them. You may also find that you’re more sensitive to bright light.  You should have your eyes tested by an optometrist (also known as an optician) if you experience any of these in one or both eyes: You have difficulty reading small print despite wearing reading glasses. Straight lines start to look wavy or distorted. You can check this by looking at door and window frames, or tiles in your home. Your vision isn’t as clear as it used to be. If your optometrist finds any changes to your macula or any cause for concern, they’ll send a letter to your GP or sometimes directly to the hospital. Based on your optometrist’s letter, the hospital will judge how quickly you need to be seen by the ophthalmologist (also known as a hospital eye doctor) and arrange an appointment for you."

What is the macula?,"The macula is part of the retina at the back of the eye. It is only about 5mm across but is responsible for our central vision, most of our colour vision and the fine detail of what we see. The macula has a very high concentration of photoreceptor cells – the cells that detect light. They send signals to the brain, which interprets them as images. The rest of the retina processes our peripheral, or side vision."
Why have I developed AMD?,"The exact cause for AMD is not known. Some things are thought to make it more likely you’ll develop AMD, such as: your age, your genes, your lifestyle, smoking, sunligh, what you eat. In general, protecting your eyes from the sun, eating a balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and stopping smoking, keeping active and maintaining a healthy weight and blood pressure may all help to keep your eyes as healthy as possible. Unfortunately, because the exact cause of AMD is not known, you may develop AMD even if you don’t have any of these risk factors."
What are the symptoms of AMD?,"As AMD progresses, many people see a blurry area near the center of their vision. Over time, this blurry area may get bigger or you may see blank spots. Things may also seem less bright than before.   Some people may also notice that straight lines start to look wavy. This can be a warning sign for late AMD. If you notice this symptom, see your eye doctor right away."
Am I at risk for AMD?,"Your risk for AMD increases as you get older. People over age 60 are more likely to have AMD. The risk for AMD is also higher for people who:   Have a family history of AMD Are Caucasian  Smoke   If you are at risk for AMD because of your age, family history, or other factors, it’s important to get regular eye exams. Early AMD doesn’t have any symptoms, so don’t wait for your vision to change! "
How can I lower my risk for AMD?,"Research shows that you may be able to lower your risk of AMD (or slow its progression) by making these healthy  choices:   quit smoking, get regular physical activity, maintain a healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and eat healthy foods, including leafy green vegetables and fish."
How will my eye doctor check for AMD?,Eye doctors can check for AMD as part of a comprehensive dilated eye exam. The exam is simple and painless — your doctor will give you some eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupil and then check your eyes for AMD and other eye problems.
What’s the treatment for AMD?,"There’s currently no treatment for early AMD, so your eye doctor will probably just keep track of how your eyes are doing with regular eye exams. Eating healthy, getting regular exercise, and quitting smoking can also help.   If you are diagnosed with intermediate or late AMD, ask your eye doctor about treatment options and how the condition may affect your vision in the future. "
How do I live with vision loss from AMD?,"Not everyone with AMD develops late AMD or gets it in both eyes. But if you do, living with vision loss from AMD can be challenging. Having low vision means that even with glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery, your vision loss makes it hard to do everyday tasks.    The good news is, there are things that can help — like low vision devices and rehabilitation (training) programs."
What is low vision?,"Low vision is a vision problem that makes it hard to do everyday activities. It can’t be fixed with glasses, contact lenses, or other standard treatments like medicine or surgery.   You may have low vision if you can’t see well enough to do things like:  read, drive, recognize people’s faces, tell colors apart, see your television or computer screen clearly "
What are the types of low vision?,"The type of low vision that you have depends on the disease or condition that caused your low vision. The most common types of low vision are:   central vision loss (not being able to see things in the center of your vision), peripheral vision loss (not being able to see things out of the corners of your eyes), night blindness (not being able to see in low light), and blurry or hazy vision"
What causes low vision?,"Many different eye conditions can cause low vision, but the most common causes are:   Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) , cataracts, diabetic retinopathy (a condition that can cause vision loss in people with diabetes), glaucoma.   Low vision is more common in older adults because many of the diseases that can cause it are more common in older adults. Aging doesn’t cause low vision on its own.   Eye and brain injuries and certain genetic disorders can also cause low vision.  "
What’s the treatment for low vision?,"Unfortunately, low vision is usually permanent. Eyeglasses, medicine, and surgery can’t usually cure low vision — but sometimes they can improve vision, help you do everyday activities more easily, or keep your vision from getting worse.    Treatment options will depend on the specific eye condition that caused your low vision. Ask your doctor if there are any treatments that could improve your vision or help protect your remaining vision."
How can I make the most of my remaining sight?,"If you have low vision, you can find ways to make the most of your vision and keep doing the things you love to do.   If your vision loss is minor, you may be able to make small changes to help yourself see better. You can do things like:   use brighter lights at home or work, wear anti-glare sunglasses, use a magnifying lens for reading and other up-close activities   If your vision loss is getting in the way of everyday activities, ask your eye doctor about vision rehabilitation. A specialist can help you learn how to live with your vision loss. This can include things like:  training on how to use a magnifying device for reading, guidance for setting up your home so you can move around easily, and sharing resources to help you cope with your vision loss   "
"If diagnosed with AMD, what questions should I ask my doctor?","Do I have wet macular degeneration or dry? Do I have it in one eye or both eyes? What stage of the disease do I have? How often should I come in for check-ups? What is the Amsler grid and how often should I perform a test with it at home? Are there things that I can do to delay disease progression? What are the current treatments for macular degeneration? Are there lifestyle changes that I should make? Should I alter my diet? Do my current medications affect disease progression? Should I begin to take vitamin supplements? Will vitamin supplementation interfere with medications, or vice versa? Are there any experimental treatments for macular degeneration?"
What is an Amsler grid?,"To discover any changes to your vision as early as possible, your eye care professional will probably have you test your own vision on a regular schedule using a small, hand-held Amsler grid. He or she may also do this at the office. At home, you will hold the chart at reading distance in good light, cover one eye, and focus on a black dot in the middle of the grid, then repeat with the other eye. If the lines of the grid appear dim, irregular, wavy, or fuzzy, you should schedule an eye exam immediately."
What is the retina and macula?,"The retina is a delicate layer that lines the back of the eye. It contains cells that detect light. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for your central vision (sight straight in front of you). The rest of the retina is responsible for your peripheral vision (sight at the edge of your vision). If you think of the eye like a camera that receives pictures, then the retina is like the film in the camera where those pictures are recorded."
What is the retina?,The retina is a delicate layer that lines the back of the eye. It contains cells that detect light.
What are the risks of having anti-VEGF injections?,"Systemic vascular risks such as a heart attack, stroke or transient ischaemic attack (also known as a “mini stroke”) are theoretically a potential risk associated with the use of these treatments, particularly if you have had such an event in the 12 months before the injection."
What are the Stages of AMD?,"There are three main stages to dry AMD. The first is Early-Stage AMD. At this stage, you might not have any noticeable symptoms. However, inside your eye, there may be some minor damage to the retina, along with small collections of deposits (drusen) and perhaps a few medium-sized deposits.  The second is Intermediate-Stage AMD. If your AMD has advanced to this stage, larger collections of drusen may be inside your eye, or the outer part of your macula may have some tissue damage. You’ll probably also notice that, in the centre of your vision, there’s a blurred spot.  The final stage is Advanced-Stage AMD. Now, in the centre of your vision, you may have a large blurred spot, which makes it difficult for you to recognise faces and read. This is because damage has been caused to the centre of your macula.  In cases of wet AMD, this is always treated as an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration."
What are the symptons of early-stage AMD?,"At  early-stage AMD, you might not have any noticeable symptoms. However, inside your eye, there may be some minor damage to the retina, along with small collections of deposits (drusen) and perhaps a few medium-sized deposits."
What are the symptons of Intermediate-Stage AMD?,"If your AMD has advanced to Intermediate-Stage AMD, larger collections of drusen may be inside your eye, or the outer part of your macula may have some tissue damage. You’ll probably also notice that, in the centre of your vision, there’s a blurred spot."
What are the symptons of Advanced-Stage AMD?,"If you have  Advanced-Stage AMD, in the centre of your vision you may have a large blurred spot, which makes it difficult for you to recognise faces and read. This is because damage has been caused to the centre of your macula. In cases of wet AMD, this is always treated as an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration."
Does the sun impact macular degeneration?,The blue rays emitted by the sun have been shown to accelerate macular degeneration more than any other rays on the spectrum. Sunlight or its reflection in the water or metals may cause the progression of macular degeneration. Sunglasses are an excellent way to block out these dangerous rays.
Does smoking affect the development of macular degeneration?,"Smoking cigarettes can accelerate the development of macular degeneration, especially the “wet” form. So think twice before lighting your next cigarette."
Why is Early Detection Important?,"Early detection is critical since macular degeneration can at times be treated before symptoms even appear. This may delay, or at the very least —reduce the severity of the condition."
Does high blood pressure affect macular degeneration?,"High blood pressure tends to worsen certain types of AMD, particularly the “wet” kind.  "
Is macular degeneration hereditary?,"Macular degeneration appears to be passed down from generation to generation in certain families, while not in others. Because macular degeneration is generally developed in the late-stages of one’s life, it is challenging to study successive generations. Further research is needed to determine any genetic association with hereditary macular degeneration."
Can Nutritional Changes Slow the Progression of Macular Degeneration?,"Research has found an association between macular degeneration and a diet high in saturated fat and low in carotenoid pigments. By eating a diet rich in fresh fruits and dark green, leafy vegetables, one can delay or diminish the severity of age-related macular degeneration. High doses of vitamins C, E, Beta carotene and zinc have also been found to significantly reduce the risk of visual loss."
"If I have macular degeneration in a single eye, will it develop in the other? "," Only one eye may be affected in the early stages, but as the disease progresses, the condition typically affects both eyes.  "
I’ve heard there are 2 types of AMD: what are they?,"Two types of AMD exist:  Dry macular degeneration, also known as atrophic AMD, is caused by the presence of yellow or white deposits called drusen growing behind the macula Wet macular degeneration, also known as exudative AMD, is caused by an overgrowth of small leaking blood vessels behind the retina The key signs and symptoms of both is a gradual loss of vision in the center of your line of sight."
Can macular degeneration be cured?,"As with any chronic, progressive health condition, there are treatments available that can help address or minimize symptoms, potentially slow progression, and help you lead a full life."
What is a low vision assessment?,A low vision assessment (LVA) determines how you can make use of your remaining vision. An Optometrist carries out the assessment at a hospital eye clinic or at home. The Optometrist will measure your useful vision and identify potential optical aids.
What can you expect during your LVA?,"During an LVA, the Optometrist will measure your functional vision for both close up and distance tasks. They will use eye charts and reading materials similar to the charts used in standard eye tests, but in a different way. The Optometrist will test other aspects of your vision using different tools, including:  The Snellen or LogMAR charts to test distance Near Vision test using differing font sizes Ishihara test to test colour perception. You will be asked to identify numbers contained within images made up of different coloured dots. Field of Vision test: looking directly forward and identifying numbers or lights in your peripheral vision. Also, you will get tested with the UK Driving Standard sight test"
How often should I have a LVA?,"As macular disease can progress and reduce your vision further, an LVA may be required to recommend new techniques and optical aids to help you use your remaining sight. If you find the glasses or optical aids you are using are no longer effective, talk to your Ophthalmologist or GP about completing another low vision assessment."
What is Skills for Seeing?,"Skills for seeing is one-to-one advice from the Macular Society on how to make best use of the vision you have to continue doing the things you love. Combining vision know-how, magnification, lighting and, where it works for you, ‘eccentric viewing’ and ‘steady eye strategy’ techniques. Sessions can be delivered in a number of ways, at no cost to you.  The service can be provided by trained staff or volunteers on a one-to-one basis, usually over one to three one-hour sessions spread over several weeks.  These sessions are usually delivered in your own home or at a local sight support centre, where available.  If you are interested, please call the Advice and Information Service on 0300 3030 111 ."
Can I registered as sight impaired?,"If you have a permanent visual impairment, you may be eligible to be registered as sight impaired. Being registered often makes it easier to get practical help, and you may qualify for certain benefits.   Registration is voluntary. There are two categories of registration: Sight Impaired and Severely Sight Impaired.  The loss of sight in one eye does not qualify you for registration."
Why should I register as sight impaired?,"Being registered as sight impaired (partially sighted) or severely slight impaired (blind) may entitle you to some additional support, such as:  free NHS sight tests protection under the Equality Act 2010 railcards and other rail or travel concessions local travel services, for example Dial-a-Ride or volunteer car services free 195 Directory Enquiry Service Articles for the Blind free postage service Being registered as Severely Sight Impaired will entitle you to:  blind person’s personal income tax allowance 50% off the television licence fee Automatic entitlement to a Blue Badge parking permit and other local parking schemes"
How do I register as sight impaired?,"In order to register as sight impaired, a hospital consultant Ophthalmologist must examine your eyes to register you. If you are not already attending your local eye clinic, your GP or Optometrist can make a referral."
How is my registration as sight impaired decided?,"The Ophthalmologist will measure your visual acuity (how good you are at seeing detail) and your field of vision (how much you can see from the side of your eye while looking straight ahead). They will look at the combined results to decide whether you’re eligible to be registered as sight impaired or severely sight impaired.  If the ophthalmologist thinks that you are suitable for registration, they will complete a ‘Certificate of Visual Impairment’ (CVI) form (‘A655’ in Northern Ireland, ‘CVI Scotland’ form in Scotland). This form records information about your condition and completes your certification. The register is confidential and held locally, so if you move you will need to re-register."
What is Personal Independent Payment (PIP)?,"Personal Independence Payment is a disability benefit paid to people over the age of 16 but under pension age. The benefit is paid in two parts: Mobility and Daily Living. Both of these are paid at either standard or an enhanced rate. The benefit can be for Mobility or Daily Living at either level, or a combination of both.  To claim PIP the applicant completes a form and has a face-to-face assessment with an independent medical professional. This process establishes whether the applicant meets the criteria to receive an award of PIP."
What is Attendance Allowance (AA)?,"Attendance Allowance is a non-means-tested benefit for people over pension age. This benefit is for those who need help with personal care because of a disability or health problem and is paid by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).  There are two payment levels. The lower rate is for people who need support with personal care, day or night. The higher rate is for those who need support with personal care day and night."
Do I qualify for Attendance Allowance (AA)?,"You may qualify for Attendance Allowance if you have had your condition for at least six months and have been present and resident in the UK. If you have been out of the country for periods of longer than four weeks within the last three years may not be entitled to this benefit.  You do not have to be registered as visually impaired to claim AA, but it does help as evidence. Being registered is not a guarantee of qualifying for AA, particularly at partially sight impaired level. You need to cite other conditions too and send as much medical evidence as possible.  You can provide alternative evidence about your sight loss, such as a letter from your consultant or GP."
How do I claim Attendance Allowance (AA)?,"The best way to claim for Attendance Allowance is via post. If successful, your claim is backdated to the date of your application. There are services, such as Age UK,  to help you fill out the form correctly. You are given six weeks to complete it and it takes 8-10 weeks for your application to be processed.  To get a form, contact the Attendance Allowance helpline: 0800 731 0122 "
How to appeal my Attendance Allowance (AA) claim?,"If your claim for Attendance Allowance is rejected, you do have the option to appeal this decision. Instructions on how to do so will come with the decision letter of your initial claim.  It is best if you do choose to appeal, to get help with this from the relevant services, such as Age UK."
Can I get Welfare benefits?,"Depending on your circumstances, you may be entitled to financial support from the government. Welfare benefits are available to help those living with macular disease, and their families, with extra costs."
What is Personal Independence Payment (PIP)?,"Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is a benefit paid to people to pay for the additional costs of a disability or long term illness. PIP was introduced 2013 to replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA). You can no longer apply for DLA over the age of 16 and anyone receiving DLA will be moved across onto PIP. For children under the age of 16 the DLA is still in place.  PIP is paid by DWP once every 4 weeks directly into your bank account. It is a non-income related benefit which means that you could be entitled to PIP if you for fill the criteria. It does not relate to any other household income, which may include: wages, pensions, savings or any other welfare benefit. Like DLA, PIP is made from 2 components, Daily Living and Mobility. Each component has 2 award levels, standard and enhanced. Claimants can be awarded a combination of both components at either level depending how you are assessed during your application. The assessment is based around a set of descriptors, which award points toward each component, to obtain the standard rate you need to score 8 points and for the enhanced rate, 12 points.  PIP is awarded for set periods of time, at the end of which you will be re-assessed."
How to apply for Personal Independence Payment (PIP)?,"To apply for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) call the PIP Claim line on: 0800 917 2222. As part of this call DWP will ask you for some personal details which you will need to have ready when you make the call, these are, National Insurance number, name and address of your GP and bank account details.  DWP will send you a PIP 2 form, ‘How does your disability affect you?’ which needs to be returned to DWP within 28 days. However, you can request additional time if required. It is important that you return the form within the specified time otherwise your claim could stop.  As part of this call you are able to request any further communication in large print including the application form. DWP are also able to keep you up to date with your application via text message.  "
What is Disability Living Allowance (DLA)?,"Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is to pay for the additional costs of your child’s long term health condition or disability. The benefit is split in to two parts, Mobility and Care or a combination of the two and is paid for your child up to the age of 16 years old.  The Mobility component is paid at two levels dependant on your child mobility needs. The Care component is paid at 3 levels, low, middle and high depending on the additional support your child requires due to their long term health condition or disability. "
Who is eligible for Disability Living Allowance (DLA)?,"DLA is paid for children under the age of 16. The claim can be made by parents, carers or guardians, foster parents and older siblings who have caring responsibilities for the child.  The benefit considers the additional needs of the child compared with where you would expect a child of average health to be developmentally as well as how their long term condition or disability effects them.  The Mobility component can be paid from the age of 3 and the Care component from when the additional needs of the child become apparent. There are different rules if the child is considered to have a terminal illness.  The claim will come to an end as the child turns 16, where they will be invited to apply for Personal Independence Payment.  Disability Living Allowance is non means tested, so parents or guardian’s incomes are disregarded as well as any savings that the child has. The child must also not be under any immigration restrictions."
How to apply for Disability Living Allowance (DLA)?,"Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is a benefit that is paid for young people under the age of 16, the application is considered on a paper based assessment, there is usually no face to face medical assessment. There are two different ways of making an application for DLA you can either download a DLA pack from the gov.uk website or call the DLA Claim Line on 0800 121 4600. If you call the DLA claim Line you will be sent a pack to complete which if you return the completed form to DWP within 6 weeks you will receive a back date, if your claim is successful, to the date you requested the form.  When completing the application enclose as much medical evidence of the child’s condition or disability as you can. This can include a certificate of visual impairment, hospital medical assessments, information from QTVI’s and any other relevant documentation regarding the child’s development, condition or disability."
What kind of work can I do?,"The job market is open to people with sight loss, but having macular disease will restrict the kind of work you are able to do. Some jobs will not be possible to do with sight loss. However, there is plenty of scope and with the technology available today, there are many opportunities for people with sight loss. If you have the right skills and relevant experience for a role, sight loss may be less of a barrier."
What is Access to Work (ATW)?,"Access to Work (ATW) is a government scheme run by Job Centre Plus. The scheme supports people with disabilities and long-term conditions in the work place. ATW gives a discretionary award to support disabled employees with:  specialist equipment support workers travel to work The scheme can also fund advice for employers and training to colleagues in how to be work with someone with a disability and in some instances, ATW can also fund communication support for job interviews.  "
Who is eligible for  Access to Work (ATW)?,ATW is available to people with a disability that has an expectation of lasting at least 12 months. The disabled applicant must be employed or about to start paid employment. The job can be permanent or temporary and there are no minimum hours that the applicant needs to work to entitle them to the scheme. The disabled persons condition must be expected to be ongoing for at least 12 months.
How to apply for Access to Work (ATW)?,"If you are starting a new job or changing roles within your workplace you may be entitled to Access to Work (ATW). If your health condition changes whilst in your current position and this change is impacting on how you are able to carry out your responsibilities, you also may be entitled to make a claim.  To make a claim for ATW, contact Job Centre Plus on 0800 121 7479. You should make a claim:  as soon as you know when your start date is if there is a change in your macular disease which is impacting on your work if you are changing job roles The advisor will need to know your name, national insurance number and employer’s details including the name of your line manager. If you are starting a new job the advisor will also need to know your approximate start date. You should apply for ATW as soon as you know the date you are going to start as this will help get the support you require in place more quickly.  The advisor will need a job description as this will help them determine how ATW could best support you within your role. It is a good idea to think about your work responsibilities and where you may struggle to complete these tasks without the support of specialist equipment, a support worker or any other adjustments. You should also consider how you are able to get to and from work. People with Macular Disease could be able to use the ‘Travel to Work’ part of the scheme and if travel is required as part of their role they may be entitled to us the ‘Travel in Work’ scheme."
What support does Access to Work provide?,The Access to Work (ATW) scheme may pay for equipment and any other support considered more than a reasonable adjustment for your employer.  The scheme covers all aspects of employment in order to support a disabled person to be effective in the work place. After an assessment a person with macular disease could be offered the following support:  Specialist Software Magnifiers Support Workers Travel in Work Travel to Work Training for the applicant Work place assessment and training for the employer
How much is the Access to Work Grant?,"Access to Work can pay up to 100% of the approved costs of the claim. This depends on how long you have been employed, what support is required or whether you are self-employed. These costs are for:  Unemployed people starting a job All self-employed people Employers with less than 10 staff People working for an employer with more than 10 staff but who have been in the job for less than 6 weeks People changing jobs with a new employer The costs include:  Support Workers Communicator support at a job interview Travel to work Access to Work pay a proportion of the cost for adaptions and specialist equipment for people who have been employed for 6 weeks or more. The cost are shared with the employer as follows:  Less than 50 staff ATW can pay up to 100% of the costs. 50 – 249 staff ATW can pay up to 80% of costs after the first £500 and up to £10,000. 250 staff or more ATW can pay up to 80% of the costs above the first £1000 and up to £10,000. Access to Work grants are in line to rise at the same rate as the average salary, if the cap is reached this is likely to impact Support Worker costs and the costs of travel to and from work. In all cases ATW will explore additional contributions from the employer."
How long does an Access to Work claim last?,An Access to Work grant can last up to 3 years. At the end of the award period you will be asked to make a new claim. This is taken as complete renewal and will be assessed as such. This can be used as an opportunity to update equipment and to review Support Worker costs.
How can I read if I have macular disease?,"Macular disease can make it more difficult to read. As your vision gets worse, reading can become frustrating. However, with a few adjustments you can continue to read. The macula needs good light to be able to work, therefore improving the light on the page that you are trying to read can make it easier to see. A low vision assessment will help you to select the most suitable magnifiers and train you to use them. You may need different magnifiers for different activities. Large print products and reading materials are available both through your local sight-loss organisation and online. These products will support you to continue reading. As reading becomes more difficult, literature in audio format is a good alternative to reading.Typoscopes are simple but useful tools. They are often made of black card or plastic with holes cut in them to act as a guide when reading or writing. A credit card sized version of this, called a signature guide, is very useful for signing cheques and documents. "
How can I write if I have macular disease?,"Macular disease can make it difficult to read your own or someone else’s handwriting; consider the following suggestions to make writing easier:  Handwriting Choose paper with a matt finish as this will reduce glare from the page. Yellow or different coloured paper can create good colour contrast. Use a black fibre-tipped pen - these come in various thicknesses. You may find you need to increase the thickness of your pen as your macular disease progresses. It is best not to use joined-up handwriting as this can be hard to read, especially when magnified. Writing on a computer or other device Digital devices have become more accessible and are being used by people with macular disease. People are using these devices to send emails, text messages and to browse the internet. These devices can be adapted to make images/text easier to see/read:  Choose a plain and clear font such as Arial. Avoid making text bold, italic or underlined. This can make it harder to read. Set margins to the left and justify the text. Justifying text makes it easier to track when using a magnifier. Don’t write sentences in block capitals - using lowercase makes the text easier to track. Where possible do not use columns as this makes reading documents with a magnifier slower."
How can I prepare food?,"It does not matter whether you are preparing food or making a cup of tea; using the principle of big, bright and bold will make this easier to do with macular disease. The colour contrast is key as it will make everything stand out more. There are many items that you can buy from the high street to help you continue cooking. Use different coloured chopping boards: for example, it can be hard to see a tomato on a red chopping board - using a white chopping board to slice tomatoes makes them easier to see, with the contrast of red on white. Sharp knives: try to keep knives sharp as they will cut through food more easily, and are less likely to bounce off a bone or slip and cut you. Use a bigger knife and keep the tip of the knife on the chopping board as this allows more control over the blade. Using brightly coloured cooking utensils will help you find them more quickly when you put them down on the worktop. Add brightly coloured tape to utensils you already have to create additional contrast. Pots and pans are widely available in bright colours, which can make them stand out on the hob. Try to buy pans with glass lids as this reduces the number of times you need to take the lid off to see if the food is cooking. Buy a chip pan, but not for cooking chips - put vegetables in the basket and top up with water. When the vegetables are cooked, you can lift them out all at once. "
Which kitchen gadgets can help me prepare food?,"Macular disease makes reading kitchen gadgets difficult; there are many different adapted small kitchen gadgets for people with sight loss.  Kitchen scales are available both as talking scales and in large print. Measuring jugs are available in large print. Liquid level indicator: this device hangs over the edge of your mug or glass and will beep and vibrate when the liquid touches the sensor. Bump-ons: these are small raised dots, which can be placed around the kitchen. They could be used for example to indicate a specific temperature on the oven, or time on your microwave. Talking microwaves are very useful if you are unable to see the dials or display on a microwave. RNIB Penfriend is a handheld device, which reads out your own audio labels. Stick an audio label onto items such as jars of spices, tins and condiments; you can then record what that item is onto the device. Use the Penfriend to tap the label and it will repeat back to you what that item is. Hot water dispenser: the size of a standard kettle which dispenses one mug of boiling water at a time."
How can I improve my kitchen?,"There are some other changes you can make to make life easier in the kitchen.  Increase the lighting in your kitchen. Making it brighter will make everything easier to see. Your local sensory support team will be able to advise you on this. Lighting underneath top cupboards will brighten the worktops. When you are preparing food you cast a shadow, and these lights help with this. A task lamp will also help with this. Put coloured tape on the inside of your kitchen cupboard doors as this creates colour contrast. This hopefully will make it less likely that you will walk into them."
How can I make eating and drinking easier?,"You have prepared yourself a lovely meal, and now it’s time to sit down and eat. There are a few things you can do to make this easier with macular disease.  Try to eat somewhere in good light. Good lighting will make the food that you are eating stand out on your plate. Create good colour contrast between the table and your crockery. You could use a different coloured tablecloth or place mat. Coloured glasses and different coloured coasters can also help create good colour contrast. Locate your glass with your hand near the table; if you misjudge the distance, you are less likely to knock it over. It may be necessary on occasion for someone to point out where the food is on your plate; using a clock face to describe where things are can be very helpful. "
How can I do my personal care?,"It can be very difficult identifying the items you need day to day to look after yourself, such as shampoo or soap.  By putting different brightly coloured tape around shampoo and conditioner bottles, it makes them easier to tell apart.  Similarly, buying soap that is a different colour to your soap dish and a brightly coloured toothbrush will help make them stand out against the background of your bathroom.  Try applying toothpaste directly to your tongue to avoid missing the toothbrush when brushing your teeth.  Smart showers can connect to your smart speaker, meaning you can turn the shower on and off and change the temperature using your voice.  To ensure you can get in and out of the bath or shower safely, buy a brightly coloured non-slip bathmat.  You can peg your shoes together, and buy socks all the same colour, so you’ll know that they always match. When it comes to clothing, you could sew a different shaped button for each colour on the inside tags so it’s easier to differentiate between similar colours such as black and navy blue.  Smartphone apps can be used to help identify different coloured items of clothing and help put outfits together. Some can connect you to another person who can help to identify items using the camera.  A small torch or spotlights inside your wardrobe will help you to identify items of clothing much more easily."
How can I make the most of natural daylight?,"Make the most of natural daylight, while controlling glare.  Open curtains wide and keep windows clean. Remove net curtains. Use vertical blinds, not horizontal. They’re easier to control light levels and enable you to change the direction of light coming into the room. Roller blinds can help you control the amount of light coming in and prevent it shining in your eyes. Blue blocker filter lenses in glasses can improve contrast and reduce glare. "
How can task lighting help me?,"Effective task lighting can really help. It can:  be helpful in the kitchen. Under-cupboard lighting can be very effective for lighting work surfaces make reading easier by improving the contrast of text on the page make it easier to identify colours help to break through mistiness in vision reduce the amount of magnification needed. Task lamps need to be positioned below eye level, shining onto the task, not into your eyes.  They should be stable to avoid getting knocked over, and bulbs should stay cool to avoid discomfort or even burning yourself."
What type of task lamp should I buy?,"When buying a task lamp consider:  What activities do you want it for? Would a table-top, floor-standing or wall-mounted one be best? How easy is it to adjust its position to get the light where you need it? Does the shade stop the light shining directly into your eyes when the lamp is positioned below eye level?"
What kind of light bulb should I use?,"Traditional tungsten light bulbs have been phased out because they get hot and use a lot of energy. New low-energy efficient bulbs get bright very quickly, are cost efficient to run and come in a range of brightness levels, shapes and fittings.  Types of light bulbs Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) offer instant crisp, bright light. They tend to be more expensive than other products but can save money as they are long-life and energy efficient. Compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) are fluorescent tubes curved or folded into various shapes and compact enough to suit a range of light fittings. They are energy efficient and long-life bulbs. They may take time to reach full brightness but there are ‘quick start’ products that warm up faster. Unfortunately most CFLs can’t be used with standard dimmer switches. Fluorescent tubes produce less heat and use less energy. A single long straight type of this bulb is often used in the kitchen. Replacing these with multiple lights will provide more even light. LED lights are now available as a ‘bulb’ version or in a ‘strip’ light format similar to the traditional CFL strip light. Halogen lighting produces a very bright, light but gets extremely hot. Avoid the narrow beam spotlights. Be careful when changing halogen bulbs; use a cloth – the natural oil on skin will damage the bulb. Halogen lighting is cheap and provides instant brightness but isn’t as energy efficient as CFLs or LEDs."
Can I drive if I have macular degeneration?,"Having macular degeneration does not automatically mean you have to stop driving. Many people still meet the legal requirements and can continue to drive safely and legally.  However, if your eye specialist says you have any sight condition in both eyes which cannot be corrected with prescription glasses, you have a legal duty to inform your driving licence authority. If you don't, you could be breaking the law and this can result in a fine of up to £1,000.  You should also inform your car insurance provider. This is the case even if you feel your sight is still good."
Can I drive abroad if I have macular degeneration?,"Most European countries conform to the same sight regulations. However, some parts of the world may have different requirements. Before travelling abroad, check if you are still eligible to drive."
Can I get help with train travel?,"There are many types of rail cards which offer discounted and reduced cost travel. Rail cards include cards for disabled travellers and older people.  Disabled Person Rail Card - gives a third off the cost of tickets for the railcard holder and one companion. To be entitled to this card you need to be registered as sight impaired (partially sighted) or severely sight impaired (blind) Assisted Travel - Visually impaired people can contact the Passenger Assistance Service through National Rail Enquiries on 0800 022 3720. This service supports visually impaired travellers with locating their trains and connections. Book this service at least 24 hours in advance of travel. London Underground Staff will assist people with sight loss around their network. All train travel in Scotland is free to people who are registered as sight impaired or severely sight impaired. Most trains have accessible areas providing more space to travel, so either try to book these or request to be seated in that area. Sometimes these are even in first class!"
Can I get help with buses and coach travel?,"Local authorities and some national coach services offer discounted travel to people who are registered as sight impaired or severely sight impaired. National Bus Pass - England: bus customers who are registered sight impaired or severely sight impaired are entitled to free off-peak travel on local bus services. Some local authorities extend this to 24-hour travel on local bus routes. Similar schemes are available in Wales and Northern Ireland. Free bus travel is available in Scotland to people registered as sight impaired or severely sight impaired. Companion Pass: depending on your circumstances, you may be entitled to support from a family member/friend/carer on the bus. In most major cities in the UK any buses you travel on will announce which stop is coming up and which bus route you are on. National Express offer a coach card for disabled travellers for £10 per year."
Can I fly if I have macular disease?,"People with macular disease are generally able to fly. However, if you have had an injection or other treatments, it is always worth talking to your clinician before travelling."
Can I get help with air travel?,"There is plenty of help when travelling by air if you have a visual impairment. Discuss this with your travel agent or airline before you fly. After requesting assistance from your travel provider, you may be offered the following support:  Airport Special Assistance Team: after you check in, this team will guide you and your travelling companions through passport control, security and to your gate. This support then continues with assistance on to the plane, either up the steps or on an adapted lift. When you arrive at your destination, a member of the special assistance team or a holiday rep will help you off the plane and through the airport. If you have a guide dog, they will be able to travel in the cabin with you; check with the airport quarantine service where your guide dog is allowed to travel under the pet passport scheme. You need to book your guide dog onto the flight with your airline in advance."
Can I travel for holiday?,"When booking a holiday, inform your travel agent that you have macular disease. They will be able to offer information on the support they may be able to provide. This could include hotel rooms on lower floors, support with transfers to your resort and assistance with learning your way around the resort you are staying in.  There are also specialist travel agents that offer tailor made holidays to people with sight loss."
How can I get help to read a restaurant menu?,"Download the Good Food Talks app to your phone or tablet. It enables you to download a restaurant's menu and make it easier to read by adjusting the fonts, size or contrast. Make sure you have your preferred app on your phone for either magnifying the text in a menu or for having it read out to you - for example, the Seeing AI app. Look at the menu online beforehand Don't be embarrassed to ask a member of staff to help you to read the menu. Remember restaurants sometimes also have specials advertised on chalk boards. Ask if the restaurant has a large print menu"
What can help me when eating out?,"Having items such as extra menus and flowers removed from the table will make it easier to see plates, glasses, condiments etc. When booking, remember to ask about lighting over the table. Too much or too little light can cause issues. Don't be embarrassed to ask for a seating area in the restaurant which suits your needs e.g. near a window. Carry your symbol cane so that the restaurant is aware of your needs. Take a small task light - it can help you see the menu and your plate."
What technology can help me with shopping?,"Shopping with a friend or family member is helpful as they can support you in finding items you would like to buy, checking sizes and colours of clothes for example. If you prefer to shop on your own, taking some technology with you can help, such as:  Your magnifier Barcode reader Hand held digital magnifier There are also apps on your smart phone that can magnify and read barcodes."
How can I go out shopping?,"Shopping is one of life's necessities; many people find it enjoyable. Macular disease can make shopping daunting and difficult. But with a few changes, you can still go out shopping should you wish to.  The way that we shop has changed. We can now get most of our essentials from large supermarkets delivered to our door.  If you want to go out to shop, here are some tips which might help:  Think about the items that you want to buy and where you will get them. Consider a quieter time of day to go out so it's easier to move around. Visiting out of town retail parks can be less busy and easier to navigate. Creating a shopping list has become easier with today's technology. You can create a shopping list on your smart phone or tell your smart speaker to create a list, which you can then access on your smart phone. You could take the traditional route and use pen and paper in the size font you find easiest to read. "
How can I watch television?,"There are many TVs available with accessibility functions to help you to continue watching the programmes and films you love. If watching television is becoming uncomfortable, the following tips and information may help you. In the first instance, it may help to sit closer to the TV. By halving the distance, you’re creating 2x magnification. Facing the screen directly can place your worst vision in front of the screen, so if one eye is better than the other, try turning your chair about 45 degrees so you are able to look at the screen with your better eye. To reduce glare, try positioning the TV away from windows and lamps. Smart TVs can be connected to different streaming services such as Netflix, BBC iPlayer and more, where you can access TV programmes, movies, music, photos and games. Some newer smart TVs can be controlled by your voice via the TV remote, or small plug-in boxes like the Amazon Fire Stick. Some TV programmes offer an accompanying audio description. The BBC currently provides this for 20% of their schedule. This narration is in addition to the programme’s original soundtrack and provides a verbal description of the visual content. Typically it will describe scenery, a character’s appearance or facial expression, and what is going on in the scene.        "
How can I use a mobile phone?,"There are a wide range of phones available, from the simple to the more sophisticated.  At one end of the spectrum are simple handsets designed to offer a few functions with maximum accessibility. Typically these will allow you to make and receive phone calls and text messages using a tactile keypad. Screen contrast and text size can be easily adjusted. Examples include the Alto 2 and Doro PhoneEasy range.  At the other end of the scale are smartphones like the Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy, which have many advanced accessibility features.  Enlarged text and text-to-speech: Most smartphones have a large screen and the option to enlarge text, or read it out loud. Intelligent assistant: These built-in voice assistants, such as ‘Siri’ on the iPhone, work like a smart speaker. They allow you to dial contacts, dictate messages and emails, and search the internet. You can also ask it everyday questions such as ‘What’s the time?’ or ‘Will I need my umbrella today?’, and get a spoken response. Camera functions: As well as taking photographs, a smartphone camera also enables you to ‘zoom in’ on objects, just like you would with a magnifier. Apps: A key feature of tablets and smartphones are apps - downloadable pieces of software."
What are smart speakers?,"Advances in voice-activation technology, such as the Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod allow you to control your computer, mobile phone, even lights and heating using your voice alone.  With a smart assistant, you can:  Play music and audiobooks Request recipes Check the weather Control your TV Set reminders and alarms Take notes Get answers to a variety of questions Play games and listen to jokes"
I have macular degeneration – how can I see better?,"There are strategies to help you cope better despite the damage. People with macular degeneration will usually find properly prescribed magnifiers helpful, although in its early stages simple over-the-counter magnifiers will be a good start."
What is dry macular degeneration?,"Dry macular degeneration happens when debris builds up behind the macula. The cells of the macula become unhealthy so the signals which would allow you to see are no longer carried by nerves from the back of the eye to the brain. It is the more common form of the condition and tends to happen to older people. It is usually gradually progressive and may lead to moderate visual loss, however this is often not severe. Effective treatments are not yet available."
What is wet macular degeneration?,"Wet macular degeneration happens when new blood vessels grow behind the macula. Blood leakages and scarring prevent the cells from working well and central vision becomes poor. This type of macular degeneration is less common, accounting for around one case in 10, but untreated leads to more severe visual loss. There are now treatments that can stabilise the condition but they are not a cure."
What is macular degeneration?,In macular degeneration there is damage to the cells in the macula. In the early stages this can cause small print to appear distorted. As one eye is usually affected before the other you may not notice these early changes. There is no pain with the condition. As it progresses the central distortion or fuzziness can turn into a blank spot which makes it hard to read small print or recognise faces. Macular degeneration does not usually lead to total sight loss: if you have the condition you are likely to retain your side vision which enables you to get around a bit easier than without.
How do I delay the progress of macular degeneration?,"Protecting your eyes from the sun, eating a well-balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables and stopping smoking may all help to delay the progress of macular degeneration."
Can diet or supplements help with macular degeneration?,"Recent research has looked at how certain supplements can cut the chance of developing macular degeneration or slow down its progress. One study showed that supplements including vitamin C and vitamin E, which are known as antioxidants, helped when taken in combination with zinc. Lutein and zeaxanthin, found in green leafy vegetables and eggs have also been shown to have protective effects. More trials are going on to test the effect of these in combination with fish oils. These are not indicated for everyone and there are health risks from taking very high levels of certain supplements, especially if you are a smoker or have been in the last 10 years, so it is important to consult your doctor before taking these supplements.  "
How can an Amsler Grid be used to monitor macular degeneration?,"If you want to monitor your own central visual field it can help you detect early visual changes: Cover one eye, so you can spot changes in each eye in turn. Make sure you have good lighting on the page. Wear your usual reading glasses, if you need them. Cover your right eye (without pressing hard). Use your left eye to stare at the spot in the centre of the grid. Keep your eye still, and notice the horizontal and vertical lines to the left and right, above and below the central dot. Are any of them blurry, distorted, missing or wiggly? Then repeat the test with your other eye covered. If you notice any problems, repeat the test after a few hours. If the lines remain distorted or broken, make an appointment with your optometrist."
What happens if I show signs of macular degeneration?,If your GP or optometrist detects signs of macular degeneration they may refer you to an ophthalmologist at a hospital. The referral may be urgent in the case of wet AMD or routine for untreatable dry AMD.  You will be sent an appointment to see the ophthalmologist. Take someone with you who can accompany you home as you will be given eye drops which widen your pupils and give the specialist a clearer view inside. These drops can leave your vision blurry for a few hours so someone else should drive home.
What happens during a hospital assessment for macular degeneration?,"The ophthalmologist will use a bright light to look inside your eye. In some cases, that will enable them to diagnose macular degeneration. Alternatively, they may use a new sort of computerised scanner (called OCT) which can see the layers beneath the retina. They should explain about the progression of the disease and talk about the sort of help you can get.  If the specialist needs further information about changes at the back of the eye they may suggest that you have a test that uses a dye injected into a vein in your arm to show up the path of the blood vessels around your macula. This test is called fluorescein angiography, often termed FFA. Dye is injected into your arm and travels to the blood vessels at the back of the eye. The specialist takes photographs using blue light, you may feel dazzled or nauseous during and after the test, but it is not painful. It helps the ophthalmologist understand what sort of macular degeneration is present and whether treatment can help."
I have macular degeneration – who can help?,"To find out about equipment that might help, you can contact RNIB, speak to your GP or local authority’s social care department about local support. The Macular Society has a leaflet about low vision aids and also offers a counselling service. There is likely to be a group for people with sight problems local to you that can help you with practical training and support, just contact the Macular Society."
How do I help the person I care for cope with macular degeneration?,"Macular degeneration can be frustrating for the person experiencing it. Suddenly it can become harder to read small print, look up telephone numbers, tell the time on your watch and more. It is also confusing because your peripheral vision may be unaffected. Make things easier by ensuring that there is good light at home. Look into obtaining large print or talking books and write notes in a clear bold pen. Support the person you care for to find out more about local low vision services so they can access magnifiers and other equipment to help them be independent. If your loved one lacks confidence getting out and about, check out the Macular Society’s information on being a ‘sighted guide’ for someone with sight problems. You can also enquire about the availability of mobility training through the local rehabilitation officer. Local branches of the Macular Society often offer excellent support and are well worth getting in touch with."
Should I register as blind or partially sighted now I have macular degeneration?,"It is not necessary to be registered as visually impaired or severely visually impaired, to be able to access low vision aid services. Low vision aid services in most areas have a relatively open access policy and your ophthalmologist, eye nurse or optician may be able to refer you without you needing to be on the visually impaired register."
I have macular disease in one eye and I’m worried about the other one. What should I do?,"If one eye is already affected and you are getting symptoms in the other eye, most NHS or private retinal specialists will have a rapid access system in place which you can access directly or through your GP."
What are drusen?,Drusen are yellow deposits under the retina. They often are found in people over age 50. Your eye care professional can detect drusen during a comprehensive dilated eye exam.
Do drusen cause vision loss in advanced dry AMD?,"Drusen alone do not usually cause vision loss. In fact, scientists are unclear about the connection between drusen and AMD. They do know that an increase in the size or number of drusen raises a person’s risk of developing either advanced dry AMD or wet AMD. These changes can cause serious vision loss."
The dry form of AMD has early and intermediate stages. Does the wet form have similar stages?,The wet form is not separated into stages. The wet form is considered advanced AMD.
Can the dry form turn into the wet form?,"All people who have the wet form had the dry form first. The dry form can advance and cause vision loss without turning into the wet form. The dry form also can suddenly turn into the wet form, even during early stage AMD. There is no way to tell if or when the dry form will turn into the wet form."
What is the AREDS formulation?,"The AREDS formulation is a combination of antioxidants and zinc that is named for a study conducted by The National Eye Institute called the Age-Related Eye Disease Study, or AREDS. This study found that taking a specific high-dose formulation of antioxidants and zinc significantly reduced the risk of advanced AMD and its associated vision loss. Slowing AMD’s progression from the intermediate stage to the advanced stage will save many people’s vision.  "
What is the dosage of the AREDS formulation?,"The daily amounts used by the study researchers were 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 International Units of vitamin E, 15 milligrams of beta-carotene, 80 milligrams of zinc as zinc oxide, and 2 milligrams of copper as cupric oxide. Copper was added to the AREDS formulation containing zinc to prevent copper deficiency anemia, a condition associated with high levels of zinc intake.  The follow up study, AREDS II, showed slightly better results. In this study the beta-carotene was eliminated and lutein 10 mg and Zeaxanthin 2 mg were added. Speak to your eye care professional to determine which is best for your situation."
Who should take the AREDS formulation?,"People who are at high risk for developing advanced AMD should consider taking the formulation. You are at high risk for developing advanced AMD if you have either intermediate AMD in one or both eyesORadvanced AMD, dry or wet, in one eye but not the other eye.  Your eye care professional can tell you if you have AMD, its stage, and your risk for developing the advanced form. The AREDS formulation is not a cure for AMD. It will not restore vision already lost from the disease. However, it may delay the onset of advanced AMD. It may help people who are at high risk for developing advanced AMD keep their vision."
Can people with early stage AMD take the AREDS formulation to help prevent the disease from progressing to the intermediate stage?,"There is no reason for those diagnosed with early stage AMD to take the AREDS formulation. The study did not find that the formulation helped those with early stage AMD.  If you have early stage AMD, a comprehensive dilated eye exam every year can help determine if the disease is progressing. If early stage AMD progresses to the intermediate stage, discuss taking the formulation with your doctor.  "
What can I do if I already have lost some vision from AMD?,"If you have lost some sight from AMD, ask your eye care professional about low vision services and devices that may help you make the most of your remaining vision.  Ask for a referral to a specialist in low vision. Many community organizations and agencies offer information about low vision counseling, training, and other special services for people with visual impairments.  Don’t be afraid to use your eyes for reading, watching TV, and other routine activities. Normal use of your eyes will not cause further damage to your vision."
What research is being done?,"The National Eye Institute scientists are:  studying the possibility of transplanting healthy cells into a diseased retina evaluating families with a history of AMD to understand genetic and hereditary factors that may cause the disease looking at certain anti-inflammatory treatments for the wet form of AMD. This research should provide better ways to detect, treat, and prevent vision loss in people with AMD."
Does macular degeneration only affect older people?,"Although the most common form of macular degeneration is age-related, there are many forms of macular degeneration that can affect younger people. These are all quite rare and most are caused by a specific gene defect.  Some of these forms include:  Best Disease or vitelliform macular dystrophy. Stargardt Disease:  this is the most common form seen in younger people and may appear from about 10 years of age, although vision loss may not occur until the 20s or 30s. Myopic macular degeneration:  can occur in people who are severely near-sighted due to extreme elongation of the eyeball. This condition can result in tears in the macula and bleeding beneath the retina.  Other macular dystrophies:  Sorsby's dystrophy, Behr's dystrophy and Doyne's (or honeycomb) dystrophy. "
Will I make my age-related macular degeneration worse by continuing to read?,"You will not make your age-related macular degeneration worse by reading. You may find you become tired more quickly when you are reading because you are having to concentrate more, particularly if you already have some loss of vision. You may need to have a break a bit more often when you are reading or make sure you have better lighting."
"Can 'using' my eyes cause further damage, will resting them 'make them last longer'?",You cannot hurt your eyes or wear them out quicker by using them for normal tasks. Please 'use' your eyes as much as you like. By doing so you may learn new ways of seeing things to compensate for your decreased vision.
Can 'resting' my good eye save it from developing age-related macular degeneration?,"If only one eye is affected, resting your 'good' eye has no impact on the risk of AMD developing. "
I have dry eyes. Is this the same as dry age-related macular degeneration?,"Dry or itchy eyes (which affects the front of the eye) is a different eye condition to dry age-related macular degeneration, which affects the retina at the back of the eye."
I have watery eyes. Does this mean I have wet age-related macular degeneration?,"Wet age-related macular degeneration means you have some fluid or blood leaking from abnormal blood vessels growing under the retina at the back of the eye. You cannot see this fluid or blood if you look in the mirror. The front of the eye gives us no indication of what is happening at the back of the eye or vice versa. Symptoms such as bloodshot eyes, dry or itchy eyes and watery eyes have no relationship to the retina. Any disease or damage to the retina does not affect the front of the eye in any way. You should speak to your optometrist or ophthalmologist if you have dry or itchy eyes."
Can I see for myself if my retina or macula shows any signs of damage before I have symptoms?," It is impossible to examine your own retina, which lines the inside of the eye. You need to have a full eye examination from an optometrist or ophthalmologist who will normally dilate (enlarge) the pupil to give a clear view of the retina, including the macula."
Is age-related macular degeneration painful?,AMD does not cause any pain. The early stages of age-related macular degeneration can also develop without you being aware of any visual symptoms. That's why you need an optometrist or your ophthalmologists to check your retina. A painful eye can be due to a number of other conditions and should be investigated by an optometrist or ophthalmologist.
Why don't new spectacles help?,Spectacles ‘help’ the lens at the front of the eye to better focus the image onto the retina (at the back of the eye). If the retina is damaged it cannot 'take a good picture' regardless of the strength of the lens or spectacles. An analogy is with an old style film camera. Cleaning the lens at the front of the camera will not help if the film at the back of the camera is damaged.
"Do any other eye disease such as cataract, glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy have an impact on age-related macular degeneration? ","Other eye diseases or complaints have no impact on the incidence, severity or outcome of age-related macular degeneration. Of course many eye complaints may cause vision loss or disturbance to varying degrees and if you have central vision loss due to macular degeneration, other visual symptoms can exacerbate your vision loss, but clinically they do not affect the actual disease process."
Is a macular hole the same as age-related macular degeneration?,"Macular hole and age-related macular degeneration are separate and distinct conditions. There is no relationship between the two, although the symptoms can be similar. A macular hole could be described as a 'traumatic' event, when a hole develops in the macula, due to the vitreous gel inside the eye pulling on the retina. This vitreous gel tends to shrink as we get older causing traction. In most cases, macular holes can be surgically repaired, providing they are treated early."
Is it 'normal' to experience visual hallucinations?," Up to 30% of people who have experienced significant vision loss from age-related macular degeneration or other eye conditions experience a range of visual hallucinations. This is known as Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS). These hallucinations can be mildly irritating or quite distressing, especially for those who experience vivid, random images of everyday objects or scenes at the most inappropriate times. People with CBS typically know that the hallucinations are not real, and other senses such as hearing, smell and taste, are not involved. Be assured that these hallucinations are a result of failing eyesight and are not a sign of a mental health issue. Images tend to come and go and will often settle down with time, although in some people, they can last for many years. Please discuss your concerns with your family and your doctor. It is quite possible that your GP will not have heard about CBS."
My vision is good but my eye health professional says I have the early signs of age-related macular degeneration. What does that mean?,"  The first signs of age-related macular degeneration start when the cells at the back of the eye (retina) do not efficiently remove waste products. These waste products, called drusen, build up under the centre of the retina (macula). If you have early signs, this means there are drusen under the retina. Typically, in the early stages, you will notice little or no impact on your vision. It is important to continue attending your regular appointments and use your Amsler grid to monitor your macular health.The first signs of age-related macular degeneration start when the cells at the back of the eye (retina) do not efficiently remove waste products.

"I have been diagnosed with drusen, does this mean I have age-related macular degeneration?"," Almost everyone over the age of 50 has a few very small drusen (also called drupelets). These are considered a normal sign of ageing and are not classified as age-related macular degeneration. If the drusen increase in number and grow beyond a certain size, it may be classified as age-related macular degeneration. "
Is age-related macular degeneration contagious?,AMD is not contagious. It is a degenerative disease and not one that can be passed from person to person.
"I have had dry age-related macular degeneration for years. Does this mean I'm going to get wet AMD, too?","10 to 15% of people with early, intermediate or late stage dry AMD will develop wet AMD and this can occur very quickly. For this reason, it is essential to have a regular eye test and macula check, as recommended by your eye health professional. Additionally, use an Amsler grid to check your vision at home every day, especially if you have been diagnosed with AMD. If you notice any sudden change to your vision, contact your eye health professional immediately, as any delay increases the likelihood of losing vision and potential blindness."
Is age-related macular degeneration genetic?,There can be a genetic component in many cases of macular degeneration and it is one of the three risk factors. Up to 70% of people with age-related macular degeneration have a genetic link and if you have a direct family member with the disease there is an increased risk of getting the disease. A direct family member can be a parent or sibling. At least 35 gene variations can influence one's risk of getting the disease. Other risk factors are age and smoking.
"I have geographic atrophy, what does this mean?","  Geographic atrophy is when retinal cells gradually die (atrophy), leading to patches of ‘missing’ retina and loss of central vision. This occurs in the late dry stage of age-related macular degeneration."
" I have noticed changes to my vision when using the Amsler grid, what should I do?","If you notice any sudden changes to your vision when using an Amsler grid it is critical that you advise your health care professional (optometrist or ophthalmologist) immediately and make an appointment to have your eyes tested and your macula checked. When making the appointment, state that you have had a sudden change in vision. If you are given an appointment which is more than a week away, ask for it to be sooner. Intermediate or late stage dry AMD can turn into wet AMD very quickly and delays in seeking treatment can lead to loss of sight."
Is exercise good for age-related macular degeneration?,"MDFA advises that regular exercise is good not only for your general health and wellbeing but there is also evidence that people who exercise regularly are less likely to progress to late-stage disease. In addition, exercise is important for your emotional wellbeing. "
I have vision loss from age-related macular degeneration and cataracts. Will cataract surgery be of any use?,"In people with severe AMD, most central vision is lost and the person is very dependent on their peripheral vision. If these people also have significant cataracts, cataract surgery can significantly improve the quality of peripheral vision. Several studies have shown that in people who have significant cataracts and severe AMD, cataract surgery can produce major improvements in overall quality of life, even if central vision is not improved. In contrast, people with severe AMD and mild cataracts do not usually benefit greatly from cataract surgery."
Does cataract surgery increase the risk of macular disease progression?,"Cataracts and AMD are common eye conditions that can affect older people at the same time. Some studies and anecdotal reports suggest that cataract surgery may accelerate the progression of AMD. Other studies have shown no link. On balance, cataract surgery does not appear to contribute to worsening of AMD.  In some people, dense cataracts can mask the symptoms of AMD. When a dense cataract is removed and replaced with a new intraocular lens, vision is usually much clearer meaning that the symptoms of AMD, such as distortion, can become more obvious. Some people have mistakenly concluded that the surgery made the AMD worse.  People with conditions such as 'wet' age-related macular degeneration may be receiving regular injections of an anti-VEGF drug to reduce the formation of unwanted new blood vessels and leakage under or within the retina. If these people also have significant cataracts, it is generally considered appropriate to delay cataract surgery until the new blood vessel formation and leakage has stabilised. Delaying cataract surgery will not have any negative impact on the outcome of the surgery."
