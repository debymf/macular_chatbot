"If diagnosed with AMD, what questions should I ask my doctor?",Do I have wet macular degeneration or dry? Do I have it in one eye or both eyes? What stage of the disease do I have? How often should I come in for check-ups? What is the Amsler grid and how often should I perform a test with it at home? ,"Are there things that I can do to delay disease progression? What are the current treatments for macular degeneration? Are there lifestyle changes that I should make? Should I alter my diet? Do my current medications affect disease progression? Should I begin to take vitamin supplements? Will vitamin supplementation interfere with medications, or vice versa? Are there any experimental treatments for macular degeneration?"
What happens during a hospital assessment for macular degeneration?,"The ophthalmologist will use a bright light to look inside your eye. In some cases, that will enable them to diagnose macular degeneration. Alternatively, they may use a new sort of computerised scanner (called OCT) which can see the layers beneath the retina. ","They should explain about the progression of the disease and talk about the sort of help you can get.  If the specialist needs further information about changes at the back of the eye they may suggest that you have a test that uses a dye injected into a vein in your arm to show up the path of the blood vessels around your macula. This test is called fluorescein angiography, often termed FFA. Dye is injected into your arm and travels to the blood vessels at the back of the eye. The specialist takes photographs using blue light, you may feel dazzled or nauseous during and after the test, but it is not painful. It helps the ophthalmologist understand what sort of macular degeneration is present and whether treatment can help."
How can I go shopping? ,"Shopping with a friend or family member is helpful as they can support you in finding items you would like to buy, checking sizes and colours of clothes for example."," If you prefer to shop on your own, taking some technology with you can help, such as:  Your magnifier Barcode reader Hand held digital magnifier There are also apps on your smart phone that can magnify and read barcodes."
How can I slow the progression of Macular Degeneration?,"Research shows that you may be able to lower your risk of AMD (or slow its progression) by making these healthy  choices:   quit smoking, get regular physical activity, maintain a healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and eat healthy foods, including leafy green vegetables and fish.",
How can I get help for watching TV? ,"Having a large screen will help, but sitting close to the TV will be more effective. If you go to half the distance, you will get 2x magnification; and if at a quarter of the distance, this is 4x magnification. Getting as close as possible will not harm your eyes. Make sure there are no bright lights or windows behind the screen, because this can cause glare."," If you can’t get close to the screen, then an alternative is a spectacle telescope. This is a magnifier you wear instead of your spectacles, or clipped onto your spectacles. This telescope will reduce your field of view, so can mean that you won’t see the whole screen at the same time. You can also use audio-description on your TV so you hear a description of the action that is occurring on screen."
How can I see to eat food?,"You have prepared yourself a lovely meal, and now it’s time to sit down and eat. There are a few things you can do to make this easier with macular disease.  Try to eat somewhere in good light. ","Good lighting will make the food that you are eating stand out on your plate. Create good colour contrast between the table and your crockery. You could use a different coloured tablecloth or place mat. Coloured glasses and different coloured coasters can also help create good colour contrast. Locate your glass with your hand near the table; if you misjudge the distance, you are less likely to knock it over. It may be necessary on occasion for someone to point out where the food is on your plate; using a clock face to describe where things are can be very helpful. "
What is the macula?,The macula is part of the retina at the back of the eye.,"It is only about 5mm across but is responsible for our central vision, most of our colour vision and the fine detail of what we see. The macula has a very high concentration of photoreceptor cells – the cells that detect light. They send signals to the brain, which interprets them as images. The rest of the retina processes our peripheral, or side vision."
What help is available when going on a plane?,There is plenty of help when travelling by air if you have a visual impairment. Discuss this with your travel agent or airline before you fly. ,"After requesting assistance from your travel provider, you may be offered the following support:  Airport Special Assistance Team: after you check in, this team will guide you and your travelling companions through passport control, security and to your gate.

Is there a relationship between diet and AMD?,Research has found an association between macular degeneration and a diet high in saturated fat and low in carotenoid pigments. ,"By eating a diet rich in fresh fruits and dark green, leafy vegetables, one can delay or diminish the severity of age-related macular degeneration. High doses of vitamins C, E, Beta carotene and zinc have also been found to significantly reduce the risk of visual loss."
What will be the impact of AMD on my vision?,AMD does not cause total blindness. But it can make everyday activities like reading and recognising faces difficult.,
How can I maximise lighting at home?,"Make the most of natural daylight, while controlling glare.  Open curtains wide and keep windows clean. Remove net curtains. ","Use vertical blinds, not horizontal. They’re easier to control light levels and enable you to change the direction of light coming into the room. Roller blinds can help you control the amount of light coming in and prevent it shining in your eyes. Blue blocker filter lenses in glasses can improve contrast and reduce glare. "

I have vision loss from age-related macular degeneration and cataracts. Will cataract surgery be of any use?,"In people with severe AMD, most central vision is lost and the person is very dependent on their peripheral vision. If these people also have significant cataracts, cataract surgery can significantly improve the quality of peripheral vision."," Several studies have shown that in people who have significant cataracts and severe AMD, cataract surgery can produce major improvements in overall quality of life, even if central vision is not improved. In contrast, people with severe AMD and mild cataracts do not usually benefit greatly from cataract surgery."
What is the AREDS formulation?,"The AREDS formulation is a combination of antioxidants and zinc that is named for a study conducted by The National Eye Institute called the Age-Related Eye Disease Study, or AREDS. ",This study found that taking a specific high-dose formulation of antioxidants and zinc significantly reduced the risk of advanced AMD and its associated vision loss. Slowing AMD’s progression from the intermediate stage to the advanced stage will save many people’s vision.  
What is Charles Bonnet Syndrome?, Up to 30% of people who have experienced significant vision loss from age-related macular degeneration or other eye conditions experience a range of visual hallucinations. ,"This is known as Charles Bonnet Syndrome (CBS). These hallucinations can be mildly irritating or quite distressing, especially for those who experience vivid, random images of everyday objects or scenes at the most inappropriate times. People with CBS typically know that the hallucinations are not real, and other senses such as hearing, smell and taste, are not involved. Be assured that these hallucinations are a result of failing eyesight and are not a sign of a mental health issue. Images tend to come and go and will often settle down with time, although in some people, they can last for many years. Please discuss your concerns with your family and your doctor. It is quite possible that your GP will not have heard about CBS."

A specialist can help you learn how to live with your vision loss. This can include things like:  training on how to use a magnifying device for reading, guidance for setting up your home so you can move around easily, and sharing resources to help you cope with your vision loss   "
What are the symptoms of AMD and when should I seek help?,"Everyone can have slightly different symptoms for AMD, but usually the first thing you’ll notice is that it’s harder to see detail, such as small print.","You may find that your vision has a small blurred area in the centre. Straight lines may look distorted or wavy, or like there’s a little bump in them. You may also find that you’re more sensitive to bright light.  You should have your eyes tested by an optometrist (also known as an optician) if you experience any of these in one or both eyes: You have difficulty reading small print despite wearing reading glasses. Straight lines start to look wavy or distorted. You can check this by looking at door and window frames, or tiles in your home. Your vision isn’t as clear as it used to be. If your optometrist finds any changes to your macula or any cause for concern, they’ll send a letter to your GP or sometimes directly to the hospital. Based on your optometrist’s letter, the hospital will judge how quickly you need to be seen by the ophthalmologist (also known as a hospital eye doctor) and arrange an appointment for you."
Can blue light cause macular degeneration?,The blue rays emitted by the sun have been shown to accelerate macular degeneration more than any other rays on the spectrum.,Sunlight or its reflection in the water or metals may cause the progression of macular degeneration. Sunglasses are an excellent way to block out these dangerous rays.

Do drusen cause vision loss in advanced dry AMD?,"Drusen alone do not usually cause vision loss. In fact, scientists are unclear about the connection between drusen and AMD. ",They do know that an increase in the size or number of drusen raises a person’s risk of developing either advanced dry AMD or wet AMD. These changes can cause serious vision loss.
Does cataract surgery increase the risk of macular disease progression?,"Cataracts and AMD are common eye conditions that can affect older people at the same time. Some studies and anecdotal reports suggest that cataract surgery may accelerate the progression of AMD. Other studies have shown no link. On balance, cataract surgery does not appear to contribute to worsening of AMD. "," In some people, dense cataracts can mask the symptoms of AMD. When a dense cataract is removed and replaced with a new intraocular lens, vision is usually much clearer meaning that the symptoms of AMD, such as distortion, can become more obvious. Some people have mistakenly concluded that the surgery made the AMD worse.  People with conditions such as 'wet' age-related macular degeneration may be receiving regular injections of an anti-VEGF drug to reduce the formation of unwanted new blood vessels and leakage under or within the retina. If these people also have significant cataracts, it is generally considered appropriate to delay cataract surgery until the new blood vessel formation and leakage has stabilised. Delaying cataract surgery will not have any negative impact on the outcome of the surgery."
Can you tell me about the different phases of Macular?,There are three main stages to dry AMD. ,"The first is Early-Stage AMD. At this stage, you might not have any noticeable symptoms. However, inside your eye, there may be some minor damage to the retina, along with small collections of deposits (drusen) and perhaps a few medium-sized deposits.  The second is Intermediate-Stage AMD. If your AMD has advanced to this stage, larger collections of drusen may be inside your eye, or the outer part of your macula may have some tissue damage. You’ll probably also notice that, in the centre of your vision, there’s a blurred spot.  The final stage is Advanced-Stage AMD. Now, in the centre of your vision, you may have a large blurred spot, which makes it difficult for you to recognise faces and read. This is because damage has been caused to the centre of your macula.  In cases of wet AMD, this is always treated as an advanced form of age-related macular degeneration."
What can I do when light is too bright?,"If you find outdoor sunlight uncomfortable then tinted lenses can be helpful, and grey coloured sunglasses will often make you more comfortable. Try to choose a wrap-around frame style with wide sides to stop light coming around the edges of the lenses. ","A dark tint can however make it more difficult to see, because it cuts out a lot of light. It may be better to have an over-spectacle so you can wear it when required, rather than having your spectacles tinted permanently. A visor or eye-shade, or a hat with a brim, can be helpful to block light shining in your eyes, and this can improve your vision by cutting out glare. If you are bothered by light indoors, try to use curtains or blinds to block strong light. Make sure that you are not looking at a bright window when looking at the TV screen or a computer display. "
Am I eligible to be registered?,"If you have a permanent visual impairment, you may be eligible to be registered as sight impaired."," Being registered often makes it easier to get practical help, and you may qualify for certain benefits.

Treatment options will depend on the specific eye condition that caused your low vision. Ask your doctor if there are any treatments that could improve your vision or help protect your remaining vision."
What is the treatment for Wet AMD?,"Treatment is available for wet AMD, which stops the new blood vessels from growing and damaging your macula.","This treatment usually needs to be given quickly before the new blood vessels do too much damage to your macula. If the blood vessels are left to grow, the scarring and the sight loss they cause is usually permanent."

How bad has my vision got to be to be registered?,The Ophthalmologist will measure your visual acuity (how good you are at seeing detail) and your field of vision (how much you can see from the side of your eye while looking straight ahead).," They will look at the combined results to decide whether you’re eligible to be registered as sight impaired or severely sight impaired.  If the ophthalmologist thinks that you are suitable for registration, they will complete a ‘Certificate of Visual Impairment’ (CVI) form (‘A655’ in Northern Ireland, ‘CVI Scotland’ form in Scotland). This form records information about your condition and completes your certification. The register is confidential and held locally, so if you move you will need to re-register."
How do I pour liquid into a cup?,"Plastic jug kettles don’t get hot on the outside like metal ones. If you often make a single drink, it may be worth buying a small jug kettle which can boil just enough water for one cup. For boiling a pot of water, you could fill the pot with cold water first, then transfer to the kettle to boil it, and then pour back into the pot and you know it won’t overflow. ","Preferably choose a cordless kettle to avoid trailing cables. When pouring liquid into a cup, choose contrasting colours, using a pale cup for dark liquid. The RNIB or local resource centres sell a liquid level indicator, which hooks over the edge of the cup, and beeps to indicate two different levels - one for the tea and one for the milk. If you have difficulty hearing, there is a liquid level indicator which vibrates.   "
What are the advantages of registration?,"Being registered as sight impaired (partially sighted) or severely slight impaired (blind) may entitle you to some additional support, such as:  free NHS sight tests protection under the Equality Act 2010 railcards and other rail or travel concessions local travel services, for example Dial-a-Ride or volunteer car services free 195 Directory Enquiry Service Articles for the Blind free postage service.

What are the risk factors for AMD?,The exact cause for AMD is not known.,"Some things are thought to make it more likely you’ll develop AMD, such as: your age, your genes, your lifestyle, smoking, sunligh, what you eat. In general, protecting your eyes from the sun, eating a balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and stopping smoking, keeping active and maintaining a healthy weight and blood pressure may all help to keep your eyes as healthy as possible. Unfortunately, because the exact cause of AMD is not known, you may develop AMD even if you don’t have any of these risk factors."
What can I do about my poor vision? ,"If you have lost some sight from AMD, ask your eye care professional about low vision services and devices that may help you make the most of your remaining vision.  Ask for a referral to a specialist in low vision. ","Many community organizations and agencies offer information about low vision counseling, training, and other special services for people with visual impairments.  Don’t be afraid to use your eyes for reading, watching TV, and other routine activities. Normal use of your eyes will not cause further damage to your vision."
Can delaying treatment for macular degeneration cause a problem?,"Early detection is critical since macular degeneration can at times be treated before symptoms even appear. This may delay, or at the very least —reduce the severity of the condition.",
How can I prepare food?,"It does not matter whether you are preparing food or making a cup of tea; using the principle of big, bright and bold will make this easier to do with macular disease. ","The colour contrast is key as it will make everything stand out more. There are many items that you can buy from the high street to help you continue cooking. Use different coloured chopping boards: for example, it can be hard to see a tomato on a red chopping board - using a white chopping board to slice tomatoes makes them easier to see, with the contrast of red on white. Sharp knives: try to keep knives sharp as they will cut through food more easily, and are less likely to bounce off a bone or slip and cut you. Use a bigger knife and keep the tip of the knife on the chopping board as this allows more control over the blade. Using brightly coloured cooking utensils will help you find them more quickly when you put them down on the worktop. Add brightly coloured tape to utensils you already have to create additional contrast. Pots and pans are widely available in bright colours, which can make them stand out on the hob. Try to buy pans with glass lids as this reduces the number of times you need to take the lid off to see if the food is cooking. Buy a chip pan, but not for cooking chips - put vegetables in the basket and top up with water. When the vegetables are cooked, you can lift them out all at once. "

What is the treatment for wet AMD?,The treatment available on the NHS for wet AMD is a group of medications called anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs.," As new blood vessels form in your eye, your body produces a chemical which encourages further new blood vessel growth. Anti-VEGF drugs interfere with this chemical and stop the vessels from growing, minimising further damage to your sight."
What can Social Services do for me?,"People with poor vision have a right to help from Social Services. The Local Authority has an obligation to assess your needs and then provide a package of measures. The professionals working in the Social Services department will include Rehabilitation workers, who are trained to work with visually impaired individuals in their own environment.

The rehabilitation worker may also advise training in mobility and getting around, or in kitchen skills and personal care. "
What are the different types of eyecare professionals I might see? ,"An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor with an expertise in treating eye disease, and carrying out eye surgery. Often they specialise in one particular eye disease, or area of the eye. They usually work in hospitals. Many optometrists work in a community practice on the high-street. They can prescribe spectacles, and detect eye disease. Some optometrists have an extra qualification so that they can treat some eye diseases affecting the front part of the eye. In most cases, especially those with diseases that affect the back of the eye, patients are referred to the ophthalmologist. ","Often the referral goes via the GP who knows the patient’s full medical history, which might be relevant. Also in the community practice there may be a dispensing optician who provide advice on the best spectacles for the patient, and take the required measurements to be sure the spectacles are optimal. Spectacles can also be provided by unregistered individuals, but this is not permitted for patients who are registered as visually impaired. Some Dispensing Opticians also have a specialist qualification in Low Vision, and take part in low vision care.   "
What might help me utilise my remaining sight better?,"As macular disease can progress and reduce your vision further, an LVA may be required to recommend new techniques and optical aids to help you use your remaining sight. ","If you find the glasses or optical aids you are using are no longer effective, talk to your Ophthalmologist or GP about completing another low vision assessment."
Who gets personal independence payment?,Personal Independence Payment (PIP) is a benefit paid to people to pay for the additional costs of a disability or long term illness.," PIP was introduced 2013 to replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA). You can no longer apply for DLA over the age of 16 and anyone receiving DLA will be moved across onto PIP. For children under the age of 16 the DLA is still in place.

Is there any link between cataracts and AMD?,"Cataracts and AMD are common eye conditions that can affect older people at the same time. Some studies and anecdotal reports suggest that cataract surgery may accelerate the progression of AMD. Other studies have shown no link. On balance, cataract surgery does not appear to contribute to worsening of AMD. "," In some people, dense cataracts can mask the symptoms of AMD. When a dense cataract is removed and replaced with a new intraocular lens, vision is usually much clearer meaning that the symptoms of AMD, such as distortion, can become more obvious. Some people have mistakenly concluded that the surgery made the AMD worse.  People with conditions such as 'wet' age-related macular degeneration may be receiving regular injections of an anti-VEGF drug to reduce the formation of unwanted new blood vessels and leakage under or within the retina. If these people also have significant cataracts, it is generally considered appropriate to delay cataract surgery until the new blood vessel formation and leakage has stabilised. Delaying cataract surgery will not have any negative impact on the outcome of the surgery."
